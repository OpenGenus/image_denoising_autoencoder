# image_denoising_autoencoder
In this code, we perform Image Denoising on a standard MNIST Digits Dataset, which comprises of 28 x 28 pixel images of 0-9 digits.

First we'll add Salt and Pepper noise to our dataset and then define our autoencoder with these noisy images as input and original clear images as output. 

* Background - Python3 and Keras
* Hardware - GPU, will enhance performance and reduce time also.
